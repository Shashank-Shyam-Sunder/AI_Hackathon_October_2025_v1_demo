#  Notes
# ------------------------------------------------------------
# - When using an LLM for task detection, expect some variability
#   in responses even though key parameters (temperature=0, top_p=1)
#   are kept constant. This is especially noticeable with Perplexity.
#   OpenAI generally gives more stable results.
#
# - The Google and Grok integrations have not been fully tested yet,
#   but you are welcome to experiment with them and report results.
